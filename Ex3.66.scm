;examine the stream (pairs integers integers). can oyu make any general comments
;about the order in which thepairs are placed into the stream? for example,
;about how many pairs precede the pair (1,100)? the pair (99,100)? the pair
;(100,100)? (if you can make precise mathematical statements here all the better
;but feel free to give a more qualitative answers if ou find yourself getting
;bogged down.)


;(1,1),(1,2),(1,3), ... so 99, or 200 if zero index

;98*99
;99*99
