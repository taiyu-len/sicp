;suppose we want to handle complex numbers wose rela parts imaginary parts
;magnitudes, and angles can be either ordinary numbers rational numbers or other
;numbers we might wish to add to the system. describe and implement the changes
;to the system needed to accommodate this. you will have to define operations
;such as sine and cosine that are generic over ordinary numbers and rational
;numbers
;
;
;complex numbers are made up of a cons of a real and imaginary part each of
;which an be represented by a tagged (cons 'tag value) for it.
