;draw diagrams of the environment in effect when evaluating the expressions <e3>
;in the procedure in the text, comparing how thiswill be structured when
;defintions are interpreted sequentially with how it will be structured if
;definitions are scanned out as described. why is there an extra frame in the
;transformed program? explain why this difference in environment structure can
;never make a difference in the behavior of a correct program. design a way to
;make the interpreter implement the simultaneous scope rule for internal
;definitions without contsruction the extra frame

;let becomes lambda. lambda creates a new environment.

;cuase.

;boring.
