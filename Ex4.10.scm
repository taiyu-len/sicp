;by using data abstraction, we were able to write an eval procedure that is
;independent of the particular syntax of the language to be evaluated. to
;illustrate this, design and implement a new syntax for scheme by modifying the
;procedures in this section , without changing eval or apply.

;way to much work, but it involves changing the accessors and reodering stuff
