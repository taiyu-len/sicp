;as a alarge system with generic operations evolves, new types of data objects
;or new operations may be needed. for each of the three stratagies -- gnereic
;operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed style, and
;message-passing-style --describe the changes that must be made to a system in
;order to add new types or new operations. which organiztation would be most
;appropriate for a system in which new types must often be added? which would be
;most appropriate for a system in which new operations must often be added?

;data directed should be best for adding operations
;and message passing would be ebst for adding types
