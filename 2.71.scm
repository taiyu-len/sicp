;suppose we have a huffman tree for an alphabet of n symbols, and that the
;elative frequency of the symbols are 1,2,4,...,2^n-1. sketch the tree for n=5
;n=10. in such a treee howmnay bits are required for to encode the most
;frequent symbol? the least?

;the number of bits for each is 0, 10, 110, 1110, 11110, 11110 etc.
