;suppose that the balances in three accounts start out as $10,$20, and $30, and
;that multiple processes run, exchanging the balances in the accounts, argue
;that if the processes are run sequentially, aftetr any number of concurrent
;exchanges, the account balances should be $10,$20,$30, in some order. draw a
;timeing diagram like the one in figure 3.29 to show how this condition can be
;violated if the exchanges are implemented using the frist version of the
;account-exchange program in this section. on the other hand,argue that even
;with this exchange program, the sum of the balances in the accounts will be
;preserved. draw a timing diagram to show how even this condition would be
;violated if we did not serialieze the transactions on individual accounts.
